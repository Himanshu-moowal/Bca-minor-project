Description:
The credit card approval model
The Credit Card Approval Prediction System is a minor project developed to predict whether a customer’s credit card application will be approved or rejected based on various financial and personal attributes.
This project uses Machine Learning techniques to analyze applicant data and assist banks or financial institutions in making faster and more accurate decisions.


 Objective
To automate the credit card approval process
To reduce manual effort and human error
To predict approval status using historical data
To understand how different customer features affect approval


Problem Statement
Financial institutions receive thousands of credit card applications daily. Manually verifying each application is time-consuming and error-prone.
This project aims to build a predictive model that classifies applications as Approved or Rejected based on applicant details.

Gender
Age
Income
Employment status
Credit history
Marital status
